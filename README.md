11-12-24 Benjamin - (Experience Discussion) The development of our event management system has been characterized by strong team collaboration and efficient workflow. All architectural and design decisions have been made collectively as a team, with each member having equal input and responsibility in the development process. Our initial domain analysis has proven accurate and stable, requiring no significant changes throughout the project timeline. The workload has been distributed equally among team members, with everyone contributing to system design, implementation, documentation, and testing. Through consistent communication and coordinated efforts, we've been able to complete tasks quickly and maintain steady progress. The team's cohesive approach to decision-making and shared responsibility for deliverables has contributed to a smooth development process without any notable issues.
